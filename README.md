# Stack and Heap Memory Simulator
This repository contains a stack and heap memory simulator developed as an assignment for the Operating Systems course. The simulator is designed to mimic the functionalities of a simple memory management system, including stack frame creation, variable allocation, heap buffer allocation, deallocation, and memory snapshot display.

## Features
- **Stack Frame Creation**: Ability to create stack frames for functions with specified names and addresses.
- **Function Deletion**: Deleting the function on top of the stack.
- **Integer Variable Creation**: Creating integer variables on the current stack frame.
- **Double Variable Creation**: Creating double variables on the current stack frame.
- **Character Variable Creation**: Creating character variables on the current stack frame.
- **Buffer Allocation on Heap**: Allocating buffers of specified sizes on the heap and creating corresponding pointers on the stack.
- **Buffer Deallocation**: Deallocating buffers on the heap and replacing the deallocated region with zeros.
- **Memory Snapshot Display**: Outputting snapshots of the stack and heap memory.

## Notes
- Ensure that the input commands provided adhere to the specified syntax and guidelines.
- The program will handle errors such as stack overflow, frame full, heap full, invalid pointers, etc., as specified in the assignment requirements.
